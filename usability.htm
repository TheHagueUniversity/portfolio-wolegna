		Inside the same Research for Design course, but in a different module, my partner and I were assigned to test the usability of the Rijksstudio portal belonging to the Rijksmuseum.</div>

		<div class="projtext">
		<br>
		We started by putting together a protocol, thinking about the resources needed and choosing the criteria for our participants. With everything done we selected a few participants based on the criteria, which was that they would be either art-passionates, art-related students or tourists. </div>

		A few tests later, after recording and analyzing our materials, we came up with a list of observed usability problems inside the portal, which ranged from small things such as button icons to larger things such as the landing page and also the user flow inside the website. We also created a list of possible improvements based on our research, and tips on how it can be implemented.</div>

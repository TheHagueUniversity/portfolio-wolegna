		This project took us through all the phases of the Design Thinking Process, and its main focus was on creating uncommon and surprising designs, instead of going for sellable/scalable ones. For the emhasizing part, me and my partner had to each research a user, through different methods such as interviews, informal discussions, observing their room and even shadowing the person for a day. <br>Our research was enhanced by the <em>Surprise</em>, a Dutch tradition which allowed us to observe how our users give and receive presents. Following with the next phase, defining, my partner and I have combined our 2 user portraits into one persona, which would become our focus for the next few weeks and which will represent all the needs and desires of our previous users. Afterwards we started ideating and sketching possible design options and we soon move to paper prototyping.</div>

		A few iterations later, we designed our digital prototypes and started testing with different people. A key element in our design was the randomness which welcomed our users, making the whole experience unexpected and engaging at the same time, which was really important for our "user".</div>

		Our final design would offer the user randomness, but to an extent that can be controlled by the user itself, using data input.</div>
